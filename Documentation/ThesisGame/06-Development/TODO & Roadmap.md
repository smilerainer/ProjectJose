## Known Issues & Bugs

### High Priority
- [ ] None currently

### Medium Priority

- [ ] AOE preview doesn't always clear properly on cancel

### Low Priority
- [ ] Debug logs too verbose in some areas
- [ ] Some edge cases in hex line drawing
- [ ] Menu cursor snap can feel jarring

---

## Technical Debt

### Code Quality
- [ ] Some managers have grown large (consider splitting)
- [ ] Magic numbers in some places (should be constants)
- [ ] Duplicate hex math code (consolidate into HexGrid)
- [ ] Some long methods need refactoring

### Documentation
- [x] Core system documentation (DONE - this vault!)
- [ ] Inline code comments (partial)
- [ ] API documentation generation
- [ ] Example/tutorial code

### Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for hex math
- [ ] Unit tests for action system
- [ ] Unit tests for AI behaviors
- [ ] Integration tests for battle flow
- [ ] UI automation tests

---

## Performance Considerations

### Current Performance
- Battle system runs smoothly
- No noticeable lag with current entity counts
- Hex math is efficient

### Future Scaling Concerns
- Large maps (50+ cells) may need optimization
- Many entities (10+) may slow turn calculation
- Complex AOE patterns could be optimized
- Save file size could grow large

### Optimization Opportunities
- [ ] Cache hex distance calculations
- [ ] Object pooling for UI elements
- [ ] Lazy loading for configurations
- [ ] Compress save files
- [ ] Async loading for maps

---

## Questions to Resolve

### Design Decisions Needed
- [ ] Should mid-battle saving be allowed?
- [ ] Should there be permadeath?
- [ ] Should entities persist between battles?
- [ ] How many save slots should exist?
- [ ] Should battles be replayable?

### Technical Decisions Needed
- [ ] Save format: JSON or binary?
- [ ] Version migration strategy for saves?
- [ ] How to handle backwards compatibility?
- [ ] Should settings be cloud-synced?
