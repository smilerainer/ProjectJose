# Battle System Documentation

**Godot 4 C# Hex-Based Tactical RPG Battle System**

## Quick Navigation

### Getting Started
- [[System Architecture]] - High-level system overview
- [[Scene Hierarchy]] - Scene tree structure
- [[Data Flow]] - How data moves through the system

### Core Systems
- [[Battle Manager]] - Central coordination hub
- [[Turn System]] - Initiative-based turn management
- [[Entity System]] - Character/enemy data model
- [[Hex Grid System]] - Coordinate math and pathfinding

### Combat Systems
- [[Action System]] - Skills, items, moves, talk actions
- [[Targeting System]] - Range calculation and AOE
- [[Status Effects]] - Buffs, debuffs, and conditions
- [[AI Behaviors]] - NPC decision-making

### UI Systems
- [[Input Management]] - CentralInputManager context routing
- [[Menu System]] - MenuControls and navigation
- [[HexControls]] - Hex cursor and targeting UI
- [[Inventory System]] - Item management (‚ö†Ô∏è in progress)

### Integration
- [[Dialogic Integration]] - Visual novel sequences
- [[Scene Management]] - Story progression system
- [[Configuration System]] - JSON data loading

### Reference
- [[Component Reference]] - All classes and their roles
- [[Signal Reference]] - Event system documentation
- [[Configuration Files]] - JSON structure reference

## System Overview

This is a **turn-based tactical battle system** built in Godot 4 with C#. 

### Key Features
- Hex-based grid combat with offset coordinates
- Initiative-based turn order
- Flexible action system (skills/items/movement/dialogue)
- 5 AI behavior types for NPCs
- Dialogic integration for story sequences
- Data-driven configuration via JSON
- Modular, maintainable architecture

### Design Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns** - Each manager has one clear responsibility
2. **Data-Driven** - Battle setup defined in JSON files
3. **Signal-Based Communication** - Loose coupling via events
4. **Pure Math Engine** - HexGrid does calculations, not game logic
5. **Context-Aware Input** - CentralInputManager routes by active UI

## Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Fully Implemented
- Core battle loop
- Turn management with initiative
- Hex grid math and pathfinding
- Action execution (skills, moves, talk, items)
- NPC AI with 5 behavior patterns
- Visual novel integration
- Scene sequencing system
- Configuration loading

### üöß Partially Implemented
- **Inventory System** - Framework exists, needs battle integration testing
- **Battle Results** - Hooks present, UI screen needed

### ‚¨ú Not Yet Implemented
- Main menu
- Status/party screen
- Settings menu
- Save/load system

See [[TODO & Roadmap]] for detailed implementation plan.

## Quick Start for Developers

### Running the System
1. Open project in Godot 4
2. Main test scene: `res://Assets/Dialogue/Scenes/BaseBattle.tscn`
3. Battle config: `res://data/battle_config.json`
4. Sequence config: `res://data/story_sequence.json`

### Adding New Features
- New action? See [[Action System]]
- New AI behavior? See [[AI Behaviors]]
- New UI screen? See [[Common Patterns]]

### Key Files
- `BattleManager.cs` - Start here for battle logic
- `HexGrid.cs` - Pure math engine
- `Entity.cs` - Data model for all combatants
- `CentralInputManager.cs` - Input routing
- `battle_config.json` - Defines skills/items/entities

## Contributing Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow C# conventions
- Use KISS/DRY principles
- One responsibility per class
- Prefer composition over inheritance

### Making Changes
1. Understand the relevant system first (read docs)
2. Check [[Common Patterns]] for established solutions
3. Keep changes focused and testable
4. Update documentation when adding features

### Getting Help
- Check [[Component Reference]] for class purposes
- Review [[Data Flow]] for system interactions
- See examples in existing code
- Ask for context before implementing new methods
